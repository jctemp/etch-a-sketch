# Etch a sketch

The [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) for this project was the creation of a drawing editor.
It utilises DOM manipulation to modify HTML elements representing a pixel canvas.
A goal of the task is to intensively work with HTML elements in JavaScript to make the 'static' application 'dynamic'.

## Lessons learned

Writing good JavaScript is extremely hard.
I noticed that my code became quickly 'unreadable', especially, for more complex operations.
Therefore, I tried to combat this problem with refactoring.
Still, developing a web application like this is a lot of fun!
